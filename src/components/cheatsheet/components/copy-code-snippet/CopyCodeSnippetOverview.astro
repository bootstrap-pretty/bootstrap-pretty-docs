<p>Copy Code Snippets provide a easy way for users to copy small snippets of code to their clipboard. Text is copied to the clipboard by clicking on the clipboard icon.</p>
<p>Copy Code Snippets are built on a third party library, <a href="https://clipboardjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">clipboard.js</a>, which provides copy functionality. Copy Code Snippets also utilize <a href="#tooltips">Bootstrap's Tooltips</a> to provide context when text is copied to a users clipboard.</p>
